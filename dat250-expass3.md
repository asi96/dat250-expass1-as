# Software Technology Experiment 3 #

## Technical problems I encountered while installing MongoDB ##

The installation of MongoDB went mostly without any issues. I started downloading the latest version (5.0.1) then realized that I had to get the 4.4 version instead, therefore I got an extra round of uninstall/installing the program.

## Reason about why my implemented Map-reduce operation in Experiment 2 is useful and interpret the collection obtained ##
The operation is useful incase you would want to know how much each customer shops for on average. The collection obtained maps the cust_id attribute to the price attribute which is divided on the total amounts of orders the customer has.

## Any pending issues with this assignment which I did not manage to solve ##
