# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1

### Technical problems that I encountered during installation of the software development environment and how I have solved them ###
Maven was the most difficult part of the installation. The installation guide on their own page was difficult to figure out and I ended up using a video tutorial from YouTube to get Maven installed properly. The video tutorial was of great help and I ended up with a working Maven enviroment on my PC.

### How I have validated (checked) that the software development environment is working ###
I have checked that all the required enviroments are working by running the appropriate shell commands on Windows in order to see if they have been installed and recognized by the system.

**Java:** ```java -version```

**Maven:** ```mvn -v```

**Heroku:** ```heroku --version```

**Git:** ```git version```

All the commands produced the expected outputs and therefore considered as verified.
### Technical problems encountered with the Heroku platform and how you solved them ###
Once all the different enviroments were installed I did not have any issues with anything.

### Any pending issues with this assignment which I did not manage to solve ###
Everything was completed as requested. The final app has been deployed and can be accessed with the following link:
